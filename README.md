# Memoryo - Card Matching Game

This project is an interactive card matching game based on the classic memory game "Memorize". The objective is to find all pairs of identical cards by flipping two cards per turn. If the cards match, they stay face-up; otherwise, they flip back again, and you can try to find their pairs in the next attempts.
